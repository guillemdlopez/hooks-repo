# Notes 🤓📝

This is a Custom Hooks repository for common usage hooks. It includes:

1. **useCounter**: increments, decrements and reset the state of the counter.🕢

2. **useFetch**: to perform API calls. I also included a clean up process once the component has been unmounted. It returns an array of objects with the data, a loading property (false by default) and an error property (set to false in case the data is successfully retrieved from the API).📈

3. **useForm**: it updates the value of an input and also resets the current state to the initial state, so the input is back to being empty.📝
